A console-based Spritz imitation.

Installation
------------

Unfortunately, this program is only compatible under Cygwin to my
knowledge. It uses a header called <windows.h>, which is only available on
Windows machines. It also uses the nanosleep function, which I believe is
not available except through some unix-like system. Therefore, only some
sort of combination of Windows and unix (ex. Cygwin) will be compatible.
